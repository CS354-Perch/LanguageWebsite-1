  <h1>Fortran - The first high level language</h1>

  <h2>A brief history</h2>

  <p>Fortran is the world’s first high-level programming language developed by a group of IBM scientists headed by John Backus.
  Fortran was first proposed in 1954 and its name is derived by its purpose: FORmula TRANslation, hench, FORTRAN.
  People were initially apprehensive to use fortran because it was a lot of extra work for a computer so why not just use assembly or machine code? For one,
  Fortran reduced the amount of statements in a program by a factor of 20. Additionally, in 1957 these worries were further assuaged by the release of an optimized compiler -
  yet another first for the team. After this, the use of fortran took off, paving the way for modern day programming standards and practices.</p>

  <p>Fortran is an imperative programming language designed for two main purposes. First, to better resemble human speech patterns.
  Second, to perform scientifically intensive applications. In fact, to this day, Fortran is used in complex modeling such as weather prediction,
  fluid dynamics, computation physics and chemistry, and much more. When it comes to certain operations, Fortran can be very quick - even quicker than C and C++.
  For example, Fortran can use trigonometric functions and do multiplication on an array right out of the box - it doesn’t even need to use a loop to iterate through the array to perform this task.
  This makes things like matrix multiplication much simpler. Furthermore, Fortran has been in use for over 6 decades.
  With such a long legacy, there are millions of applications designed in the language making it a foundation of the scientific community.
  Fortran has seen many different versions over the years and, while it can be a little silly at times, is just as capable as any other programming language out there today.</p>
