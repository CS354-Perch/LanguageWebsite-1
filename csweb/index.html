<h1>Fortran - The first high level language</h1>

<h2>A brief history</h2>

<p>Fortran is the world’s first high-level programming language developed by a group of IBM scientists headed by John Backus.
    Fortran was first proposed in 1954 and its name is derived by its purpose: FORmula TRANslation, hench, FORTRAN.
    People were initially apprehensive to use fortran because it was a lot of extra work for a computer so why not just use assembly or machine code? For one,
    Fortran reduced the amount of statements in a program by a factor of 20. Additionally, in 1957 these worries were further assuaged by the release of an optimized compiler -
    yet another first for the team. After this, the use of fortran took off, paving the way for modern day programming standards and practices.</p>

<p>Fortran is an imperative programming language designed for two main purposes. First, to better resemble human speech patterns.
    Second, to perform scientifically intensive applications. In fact, to this day, Fortran is used in complex modeling such as weather prediction,
    fluid dynamics, computation physics and chemistry, and much more. When it comes to certain operations, Fortran can be very quick - even quicker than C and C++.
    For example, Fortran can use trigonometric functions and do multiplication on an array right out of the box - it doesn’t even need to use a loop to iterate through the array to perform this task.
    This makes things like matrix multiplication much simpler. Furthermore, Fortran has been in use for over 6 decades.
    With such a long legacy, there are millions of applications designed in the language making it a foundation of the scientific community.
    Fortran has seen many different versions over the years and, while it can be a little silly at times, is just as capable as any other programming language out there today.</p>

<h2> Subprograms in Fortran </h2>
<p>Fortran does not have methods but instead uses subprograms when parts of 
   code are going to be reused or are too complicated to deal with in one 
   program. There are two types of subprograms in Fortran, functions and 
   subroutines.</p>
<h3> Functions </h3>
<p>Functions are used when you need to take input, perform some code, and 
   return one output value. Functions can be used in assignment statements or 
   as a parameter to another function. The compiler will evaluate the function 
   that is a parameter and pass the returned value to the function using it as 
   a parameter. So, for example, you could easily print the results of a 
   function by calling print and passing the function that you want to print 
   the results of. Functions take parameters that are passed by value.</p>
<h3> Subroutines </h3>
<p>Subroutines are used when you want to perform code that can “return” 
   multiple values or manipulate data that you are using in the rest of your 
   code. Subroutines cannot be used in assignment statements or passed to other
   subprograms. In order to invoke a subroutine you must use the CALL keyword
   followed by the subroutine and its parameters. Subroutines use pass by
   reference for their parameters, meaning if you pass a variable to a
   subroutine it can change the value of that variable in the subroutine for
   you to use later in your program.</p>
