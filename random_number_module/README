Hello Best Team

This little module has a subroutine in it called

randomize_indices(array)

It takes an ONE DIMENSIONAL array and will populate its indices with random integers
The range of the integers will be from 1 to the size of the array. So, if the array 
is size 20, then the range of numbers in the indices will be 1 through 20. There are
no duplcate numbers in the array. Example:

INTEGER, DIMENSION(10) :: A3

CALL randomize_indices(A3)

Now A3 will have its indices full with non-duplicate, random ints in the range of 1 through 10.
Enjoy!
